cj-whois is a simple perl program around Net::DNS and the whois
command line tool that tells whether a given argument is a free domain
or not. It first checks its cache, returning the cached result if
present, then checks DNS, if there's no entry checks whois, then
prints 1 if the domain is free, 0 if it isn't. cj-whois --help will
tell about the options.

USAGE:

Install dependencies on Debian systems:

 apt-get install libyaml-perl libnet-dns-perl 

Run the script:

 /path/to/cj-whois/cj-whois somedomain.com

or, of course, HOME="/path/to/cj-whois/:$HOME" then just run cj-whois
without the path.


If you want to use the 'cj-sync' tool to separate domains manually:

 mkdir ~/cj-whois
 cd ~/cj-whois

then run cj-sync after you've done some cj-whois runs, then move files
from ~/cj-whois/new/ to other subdirectories of ~/cj-whois/ to your
liking. cj-sync will hard link those files from the cj-whois cache to
~/cj-whois/new/ that determine a free domain and don't exist in any
subdirectory of ~/cj-whois/ already.
